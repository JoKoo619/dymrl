# DYMRL

Dymola Reinforcement Learning (DYMRL) is a [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment for [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) models. 

## Description
The goal of this environment is, to use the OpenAI Toolkit gym to explore and solve complex control task for Modelica models with the reinforcement learning framework. 

ModelicaÂ® is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model complex physical systems (<https://www.modelica.org/>).

For this example we use Dymola. Dymola is a complete tool for modeling and simulating integrated and complex sysmtes. It is based on the Modelica open standard (<http://www.modelon.com/products/dymola/>).
